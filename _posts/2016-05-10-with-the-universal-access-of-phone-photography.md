# With the universal access of phone photography,

the citizen's interaction with documenting surreal experiences creates a uniquely authentic archive. This infinitely growing archive is used as a window for the world to spiritually experience another person's authentic moment almost in real time, increasing communal transparency on a global scale. The ability to document the natural magic of the world with photography already bends space and time spirituality, and the global access to do so with phone cameras creates _global conscious transparency_. However, using a phone during a healing moment can arguably spiritually dilute the soul's experience. In this generation, with the constant push of technology as a way of life, we must use technology in situations in order to further our communal knowledge, instead of solely indulge in our individual egotistical habits.
