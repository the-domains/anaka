This is not rare in America—mixing has been going on for centuries since the slave trade began in 1619. However, America suffers from a sickness where our institutions, government and therefore culture completely erase the truth about the violent history of our country. Because America was created by colonization—AKA genocide against Native Americans—and then pillaged further with slavery, the white institutions still in charge as a result suffer from a literal <i>blinding guilt</i>.

It took me until I was twenty to really realize that everything I thought was ugly or weird about me was just <b>black</b> about me, and that the people around me in my own community were the people who made me feel this way.</p><p> A poetic example of how hidden yet paradoxically obvious the racism is in America lies within Claudia Rankine’s <i>Citizen: An American Lyric</i>. She explains how our society is far from healing the wounds of slavery by creating diverse illustrations of racial microagressions. Microagressions (from my perspective) are the moments when a person of color’s inequality permeates through social spaces no matter how professional or personal. The physical and psychological injuries passed down through the generations of Black Americans at the hands of white supremacy are still flowing through our veins & into our social spaces like an uncontrollable virus. One of my favorite quotes to illustrate this from Claudia is:</p><h2><b><i>“Yes, and the body has memory. The physical carriage hauls more than its weight. The body is the threshold across which each objectionable call passes into consciousness—all the unintimidated, unblinking, and unflappable resilience does not erase the moments lived through, even as we are eternally stupid or everlastingly optimistic, so ready to be inside, among, a part of the games.”</i></b></h2><p> These “games” people play in our society have obvious purpose. White supremacy lives on within the minds of more than just the white population. Many people of color suffer from the same blindness as a result of being uneducated about their realities. Freedom is found only through artistic creation as rebellion, yet can be easily appropriated and capitalized to the benefit of white industry leaders. The physical and mental violences against our black bodies are strategically swept away, except for in moments when the black man and woman are accused of being more “angry,” “ignorant” and “violent.”</p><h2><strike> Except for when a police officer shoots a seventeen year old kid.
